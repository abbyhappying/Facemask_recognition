~ Project: Detecting Facemask Wearning-Image
 
~ Background: The proposed face mask detection system is based on supervised machine learning and a convolutional neural network, the data collected from Flickr which is composed of 70,000 PNG images of people with and without face masks. 
The model has an additional feature of detecting people not covering either the nose or mouth with their mask. 
~ There are 4 models in this code: MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, CNN, and SVM.  
The code combine the four most prevailing deep learning and machine learning algorithms to face mask detection systems: MobileNet, EfficientNet, CNN, and SVM algorithms. 
In the end, the confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of those algorithms involving accuracy rate, recall rate, and precision rate.
